# pandas-challenge
Module 4 Challenge

This challenge looked at the data for 15 different schools to draw conclusions regarding budgets and overall performance relating
to math and reading scores.

Using the Pandas and instruction taught from Othmane Benyoucef, as well as help from classsmate Amanda Pigman, and additional help when needed from the AskBCS team, I was able to work through the code and achieve the expected outcome.
